# License
>"CC-BY-NC-SA - basically do with it what you want, as long as you credit me, don't offer it commercially and make your extensions/derivates available under the same license. Only exception, you're allowed to sell PCBs created/derived from this package at a price that covers your expenses but doesn't earn you any money (I guess a $ for handling is only fair, but selling a $3 PCB for $30 would be a scumbag move and in violation of the license)."
